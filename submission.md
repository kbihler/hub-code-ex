## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

I did not have the time to set up a working search. So I would start there. I would also break up my componets a bit more to isolate specific functionality, I got a good start at it but it could be refactored more. There should be more helper functions taking care of the little things. I did not add accessibility considerations, and as we spoke a lot about that I probably should have. Lazy loading the images and giving some differnt loading states. I have been trying to get better at Typescript so that is what I used, that is still a WIP for me. I would also spend time commenting things. My typical workflow is to rough out everything and go back to comment/refactor on my next passes (probably a bad habit to wait).

## How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?

I attempted to stay pretty close. I used React and Typescript for a better dev experience. I stayed with Parcel as I have not used it before, but I quite like how fast and light it is. I think it came out to be a good approximation for the exercise.

## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?

My disscussioon with Tom was great and the opputunity sounds amazing. As this role will be dealing a lot with accessibility (at least to start), I feel good about doing something for users that do not have a easy time navigating the web. I am the first one to admit, before recently, I (like many before me) had not paid proper attention to those issues. I would feel good about learning and implementing real change.

Just want to say Thanks Again!!
